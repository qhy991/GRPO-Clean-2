The reasoning process is as follows: 1) CLK_IN represents the system clock, 2) RESET_N represents the reset signal (active-low), 3) CLK_50 represents the internal 50 MHz clock, 4) RST_ACK represents the output of the reset acknowledgment circuit, which needs to be synchronized with the main clock domain.\n\nThe task is to implement a dual-clock synchronization circuit for RST_ACK. This can be done using two flip-flops, each triggered by the rising edge of CLK_IN. Additionally, we need to ensure that when the input is asynchronous, it should be properly synchronized to avoid metastability issues.\n\nNow, write the Ver",
