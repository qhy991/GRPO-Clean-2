    "code": "I need to design a module named OBUFT that implements a buffer with tristate control. Based on the given parameters and descriptions, it appears that this is likely an implementation of a buffer with tristate control (open drain buffer). This type of buffer typically has three states: high, low, and high impedance (tristate).\n\n### Key Requirements:\n- Input port `I`: The input signal\n- Output port `O`: The buffered/output signal\n- Control port `T`: Tristate enable signal\n\nThe behavior should be as follows:\n- When `T` is `0`, the output `O` is driven by the value of `I`.\n- When `T` is `1`, the output `O` is in high-impedance (tristate) state, meaning it's disconnected from the power supply.\n\nThis matches the behavior of an open-drain buffer. Therefore, we'll implement it using a simple multiplexer-based approach where the output is set to either the input (`I`) or the power supply voltage (`VCC`) depending on the `T` signal.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- We're working within a digital logic simulation environment.\n- `VCC` represents the supply voltage level (typically HIGH).\n- The output `O` can transition between HIGH, LOW, and TRISTATE.\n\nHere’s how we’ll implement the logic:\n\n- Use a single register (`out_reg`) to store the current output value.\n- On each clock cycle, update `out_reg` based on the `T` signal:\n  - If `T == 0`, then `out_reg = I`;\n  - If `T == 1`, then `out_reg = VCC`.\n\nWe will also ensure that the output is properly gated off when `T == 1`, which is the standard behavior for open-drain buffers.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n- `VCC` is defined as a constant at the top-level scope, representing the voltage level (HIGH).\n- We use a behavioral model with a continuous assignment (`assign`) to update the output every time there is a change in the inputs.\n- We avoid synthesis tools if not necessary since this is more of a behavioral simulation than hardware synthesis.\n\nLet me now provide the full implementation accordingly.",
