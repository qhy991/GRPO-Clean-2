The module should correctly implement the implied functionality and pass all test cases in the testbench.\n\nNow, please provide your solution in the strict format specified above:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 3 inputs (A[2:0]) and 3 outputs (Y[2:0]). The implementation should be based on the truth table of the 74x04 IC, specifically the 7404 hex inverter, but for three inputs and outputs.\n\nThe 7404 IC provides six independent inverters.  For this implementation, we'll use three of them.  Each inverter will take a single input and produce an inverted output.  Therefore, the overall functionality of the module will be to invert the three input signals.\n\nNow, I'll design the interface of the module.  The module will have three input wires, named A, and three output wires, named Y.  These will be used to connect the input and output signals.\n\nNext, I'll implement the logic of the module.  Since the module consists of three independent inverters, I'll use the Verilog `~` operator to invert each input signal and assign the result to the corresponding output wire.\n\nFinally, I'll test the module with a simple testbench.  The testbench will assign values to the input wires and check that the output wires are the inverse of the input wires.  This will be done using `initial` block and `forever` loops to continuously test the module.\n\nThe testbench will be written using the Verilog `initial` block and `forever` loops.  The testbench will assign values to the input wires and check that the output wires are the inverse of the input wires.  This will be done using `initial` block and `forever` loops to continuously test the module.\n\nThe testbench will be written using the Verilog `initial` block and `forever` loops.  The testbench will assign values to the input wires and check that the output wires are the inverse of the input wires.  This will be done using `initial` block and `forever` loops to continuously test the module.\n\nI'll now write the Verilog code for the module and the testbench.\n```verilog\nmodule MOD_74x04_3(\n    input [2:0] A,\n    output [2:0] Y\n);\n    assign Y = ~A;\nendmodule\n\nmodule MOD_74x04_3_tb;\n    reg [2:0] A;\n    wire [2:0] Y;\n\n    MOD_74x04_3 dut (\n        .A(A),\n        .Y(Y)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        A = 3'b000;\n        #10 A = 3'b001;\n        #10 A = 3'b010;\n        #10 A = 3'b011;\n        #10 A = 3'b100;\n        #10 A = 3'b101;\n        #10 A = 3'b110;\n        #10 A = 3'b111;\n    end\n\n    always @(A) begin\n        #1;\n        if (Y !== ~A) begin\n            $display(\"Error: Y = %b, ~A = %b\", Y, ~A);\n            $stop;\n        end\n    end\n\n    initial begin\n        #100 $finish;\n    end\nendmodule\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: You must strictly adhere to the following format.
