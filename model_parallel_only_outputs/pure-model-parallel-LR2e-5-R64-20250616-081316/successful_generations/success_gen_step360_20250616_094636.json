  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 13-bit data output, data_to_reg, nclk, reg_dest, reg_write, and rst inputs.  The module functionality isn't explicitly described, but it seems to be a pipeline register for the MEM/WB stage of a CPU pipeline.  The reference files likely provide the complete implementation details, including the logic for handling data output, register selection, and clocking.  I will create a Verilog module with these inputs and an output register, and implement the logic based on the implied functionality from the reference files.  The provided testbench is not included in the response, but the module should be complete and synthesizable.  I will ensure that the code adheres to the specified format and includes all necessary ports.\n</think>\n\n```verilog\nmodule PipelineReg_MEMWB (\n    output reg [12:0] data_out,\n    input [7:0] data_to_reg,\n    input nclk,\n    input [3:0] reg_dest,\n    input reg_write,\n    input rst\n);\n    always @(posedge nclk or posedge rst) begin\n        if (rst) begin\n            data_out <= 13'b0;\n        end else if (reg_write) begin\n            case (reg_dest)\n                4'd0: data_out <= {5'b0, data_to_reg};\n                4'd1: data_out <= {8'b0, data_to_reg};\n                4'd2: data_out <= {11'b0, data_to_reg};\n                4'd3: data_out <= {12'b0, data_to_reg[3:0]};\n                default: data_out <= 13'b0;\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\nendmodule\n```",
