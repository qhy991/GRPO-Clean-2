  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  I. The module architecture should include 13-bit output, 8-bit input, and four control signals.  II. The implementation should include a latch to store the input data.  III. The latch should be controlled by the clock signal.  IV.  The output should be controlled by the reset signal.  V.  The output should be controlled by the register write signal.  VI.  The output should be controlled by the register destination.  VII.  The output should be controlled by the data.  VIII.  The output should be controlled by the input signals.  Now, I will implement the module with these requirements in mind.  Finally, I will test the module with all the given test cases to ensure it's working correctly.\n```verilog\nmodule PipelineReg_MEMWB (\n    output reg [12:0] data_out,\n    input [7:0] data_to_reg,\n    input nclk,\n    input [3:0] reg_dest,\n    input reg_write,\n    input rst\n);\n\n    reg [12:0] data_to_reg_reg;\n\n    always @(posedge nclk or posedge rst) begin\n        if (rst) begin\n            data_out <= 13'b0;\n            data_to_reg_reg <= 13'b0;\n        end\n        else begin\n            data_out <= data_out;\n            if (reg_write && (reg_dest == 0) && (data_to_reg != 8'h00)) begin\n                data_to_reg_reg <= {5'b0, data_to_reg};\n                data_out <= data_to_reg_reg;\n            end\n            else begin\n                data_out <= data_out;\n            end\n        end\n    end\nendmodule\n```\n\n**Strict requirements:**\n- The module name must be: `PipelineReg_MEMWB`\n- Must include all required ports: output reg [12:0] data_out; input [7:0] data_to_reg; input nclk; input [3:0] reg_dest; input reg_write; input rst\n- The code must be complete and synthesizable\n- Must pass all test cases\n\n**Design Context:**\n- Complexity Score: 4.03\n- Difficulty Level: A\n\n</think>",
