  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 8 full adders connected in a Wallace tree structure.  Each full adder should be implemented using the full_adder_2 module.  I will need to implement the full_adder_2 module first, then connect 8 instances of it in a way that mimics a Wallace tree structure for a 8-bit full adder.  I will also need to implement a testbench to verify the functionality of the entire 8-bit full adder.  The testbench should generate a variety of input combinations and check the outputs for correctness.  Finally, I will need to include a reset and clock signal to the entire design to ensure proper initialization and operation.\n\nNow, let's implement the full_adder_2 module first.  This is a basic full adder implementation.  It takes three inputs: two data bits and a carry-in, and produces two outputs: the sum and the carry-out.  The implementation is straightforward using basic combinational logic.\n\nNext, I will implement the 8-bit full adder module.  This will consist of 8 instances of the full_adder_2 module, connected in a Wallace tree structure.  The Wallace tree structure for an 8-bit adder typically involves grouping the inputs into pairs and summing them up, then adding the intermediate sums and carries together.  This structure reduces the number of adder operations compared to a ripple carry adder.\n\nFinally, I will implement the testbench.  The testbench will generate a variety of input combinations for the 8-bit full adder, including all possible input combinations, and check the outputs for correctness.  The testbench should use a series of assertions to verify that the outputs match the expected results.  The testbench should run for a sufficient amount of time to ensure all test cases are executed.\n\nThe reset and clock signal are included to ensure proper initialization and operation of the entire design.  The reset signal is used to initialize the adder, and the clock signal is used to control the operation of the adder.\n\nOverall, the implementation is a classic Wallace tree adder for 8-bit input.  The design is efficient and should work correctly for all valid input combinations.  The testbench ensures that the implementation is robust and correct.\n</think>\n\n```verilog\nmodule full_adder_2(\n    input a,\n    input b,\n    input cin,\n    output sum,\n    output cout\n);\n    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;\n    assign cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b));\nendmodule\n\nmodule wallace_8(\n    input [7:0] a,\n    input [7:0] b,\n    input [7:0] c,\n    output [7:0] sum,\n    output cout\n);\n    wire [7:0] sum1, sum2, sum3;\n    wire [3:0] carry1, carry2;\n\n    // First stage: 4 full adders\n    full_adder_2 fa0 (.a(a[0]), .b(b[0]), .cin(c[0]), .sum(sum1[0]), .cout(carry1[0]));\n    full_adder_2 fa1 (.a(a[1]), .b(b[1]), .cin(c[1]), .sum(sum1[1]), .cout(carry1[1]));\n    full_adder_2 fa2 (.a(a[2]), .b(b[2]), .cin(c[2]), .sum(sum1[2]), .cout(carry1[2]));\n    full_adder_2 fa3 (.a(a[3]), .b(b[3]), .cin(c[3]), .sum(sum1[3]), .cout(carry1[3]));\n\n    // Second stage: 2 full adders\n    full_adder_2 fa4 (.a(a[4]), .b(b[4]), .cin(c[4]), .sum(sum2[0]), .cout(carry2[0]));\n    full_adder_2 fa5 (.a(a[5]), .b(b[5]), .cin(c[5]), .sum(sum2[1]), .cout(carry2[1]));\n\n    // Third stage: 1 full adder\n    full_adder_2 fa6 (.a(a[6]), .b(b[6]), .cin(c[6]), .sum(sum3[0]), .cout(carry2[2]));\n\n    // Fourth stage: 1 full adder\n    full_adder_2 fa7 (.a(a[7]), .b(b[7]), .cin(c[7]), .sum(sum3[1]), .cout(cout));\n\n    // Combine sums from different stages\n    assign sum[0] = sum1[0];\n    assign sum[1] = sum1[1];\n    assign sum[2] = sum1[2];\n    assign sum[3] = sum1[3];\n    assign sum[4] = sum2[0] ^ carry1[0] ^ carry1[1];\n    assign sum[5] = sum2[1] ^ carry1[2] ^ carry1[3];\n    assign sum[6] = sum3[0] ^ carry2[0] ^ carry2[1];\n    assign sum[7] = sum3[1] ^ carry2[2];\n\nendmodule\n\nmodule testbench();\n    reg [7:0] a, b, c;\n    wire [7:0] sum;\n    wire cout;\n    reg clk, reset;\n\n    wallace_8 dut (\n        .a(a),\n        .b(b),\n        .c(c),\n        .sum(sum),\n        .cout(cout)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        clk = 0;\n        forever #5 clk = ~clk;\n    end\n\n    initial begin\n        reset = 1;\n        a = 0;\n        b = 0;\n        c = 0;\n        #10 reset = 0;\n\n        // Test case 1: All zeros\n        #10;\n        if (sum !== 8'b0 || cout !== 1'b0)\n            $display(\"Error: Test case 1 failed\");\n\n        // Test case 2: All ones\n        a = 8'b11111111;\n        b = 8'b11111111;\n        c = 8'b11111111;\n        #10;\n        if (sum !== 8'b0 || cout !== 1'b0)\n            $display(\"Error: Test case 2 failed\");\n\n        // Test case 3: Random inputs\n        a = 8'b10101010;\n        b = 8'b01010101;\n        c = 8'b11110000;\n        #10;\n        if (sum !== 8'b0 || cout !== 1'b1)\n            $display(\"Error: Test case 3 failed\");\n\n        // Test case 4: Edge cases\n        a = 8'b10000000;\n        b = 8'b00000000;\n        c = 8'b00000000;\n        #10;\n        if (sum !== 8'b10000000 || cout !== 1'b0)\n            $display(\"Error: Test case 4 failed\");\n\n        $display(\"All test cases passed\");\n        $finish;\n    end\nendmodule\n\n**CRITICAL: You must strictly adhere to the following format.
