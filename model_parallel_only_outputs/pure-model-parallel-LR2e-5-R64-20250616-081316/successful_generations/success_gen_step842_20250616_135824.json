  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 3 inputs (A[2:0]) and 3 outputs (Y[2:0]).  The reference code suggests the implementation of a specific digital logic circuit with 3 inputs and 3 outputs, potentially involving some complex logic.\n\nTo ensure that the module is implemented correctly, I'll need to understand the expected behavior of the circuit.  The reference code provides a testbench, so I should study that and understand the expected output for different input combinations.\n\nNext, I'll design the module interface.  It needs to have 3 input signals (A[2:0]) and 3 output signals (Y[2:0]).  I'll need to implement the logic that produces the correct output for each input combination.\n\nNow, I'll implement the logic within the module.  Based on the testbench, I can infer that the circuit might be implementing a specific function, such as a multiplexer, decoder, or some combination of logic gates.  I'll need to implement the logic that produces the expected output for each input combination.\n\nFinally, I'll write the testbench.  This will include the stimulus generation, the expected output, and the verification process.  I'll need to ensure that all test cases are covered and that the module behaves as expected.\n\nI'll now implement the module and the testbench in Verilog.  The module will be named `MOD_74x04_3`.  It will have 3 inputs (A[2:0]) and 3 outputs (Y[2:0]).  The testbench will generate all possible input combinations and verify that the outputs are correct.  I'll ensure that the code is complete, synthesizable, and passes all test cases.\n\nI have completed the implementation of the module and the testbench.  The code is ready for simulation and verification.  I will now provide the final code in the requested format.\n</think>\n\n```verilog\nmodule MOD_74x04_3 (\n    input [2:0] A,\n    output [2:0] Y\n);\n    assign Y[0] = ~A[0];\n    assign Y[1] = ~A[1];\n    assign Y[2] = ~A[2];\nendmodule\n\nmodule MOD_74x04_3_tb;\n    reg [2:0] A;\n    wire [2:0] Y;\n\n    MOD_74x04_3 dut (\n        .A(A),\n        .Y(Y)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        // Test case 1\n        A = 3'b000; #10; if (Y !== 3'b111) $finish(1);\n        // Test case 2\n        A = 3'b001; #10; if (Y !== 3'b110) $finish(2);\n        // Test case 3\n        A = 3'b010; #10; if (Y !== 3'b101) $finish(3);\n        // Test case 4\n        A = 3'b011; #10; if (Y !== 3'b100) $finish(4);\n        // Test case 5\n        A = 3'b100; #10; if (Y !== 3'b011) $finish(5);\n        // Test case 6\n        A = 3'b101; #10; if (Y !== 3'b010) $finish(6);\n        // Test case 7\n        A = 3'b110; #10; if (Y !== 3'b001) $finish(7);\n        // Test case 8\n        A = 3'b111; #10; if (Y !== 3'b000) $finish(8);\n        // All tests passed\n        $display(\"All tests passed!\");\n        $finish;\n    end\nendmodule\n```",
