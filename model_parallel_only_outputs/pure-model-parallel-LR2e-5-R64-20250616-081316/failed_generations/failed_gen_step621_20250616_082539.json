  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 4-bit data input (data_in), clock signal (clk), reset (rst), and two 4-bit output signals (data_out_a, data_out_b).  The module should implement a simple 4-bit counter, resetting on the positive clock edge and counting up to 15 (0x0F).  The counter value should be output on both data_out_a and data_out_b ports.\n\nTo ensure the design meets the requirements, I will implement a 4-bit counter using a register (cnt_reg) that increments on each clock cycle.  When the reset signal is asserted, the counter will be set to 0.  When the counter reaches 15 (0x0F), it will wrap around to 0.  The counter value will be simultaneously assigned to both data_out_a and data_out_b.\n\nThe testbench should include a process that generates the clock signal, and another process that asserts and deasserts the reset signal at the beginning of the simulation.  The testbench should also include a process that monitors the outputs and checks if they match the expected values.\n\nI will use a simple behavioral model to implement the 4-bit counter.  The counter will be implemented using a single always block with a continuous assignment to the outputs.  This should be sufficient to meet the requirements of the given problem.\n\n```verilog\nmodule interface_138 (\n    input wire [3:0] data_in,\n    input wire clk,\n    input wire rst,\n    output reg [3:0] data_out_a,\n    output reg [3:0] data_out_b\n);\n\n    reg [3:0] cnt_reg;\n\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin\n        if (rst) begin\n            cnt_reg <= 4'b0000;\n        end else begin\n            cnt_reg <= cnt_reg + 1'b1;\n        end\n    end\n\n    always @(*) begin\n        data_out_a = cnt_reg;\n        data_out_b = cnt_reg;\n    end\n\nendmodule\n\nmodule testbench;\n\n    reg [3:0] data_in;\n    reg clk;\n    reg rst;\n    wire [3:0] data_out_a;\n    wire [3:0] data_out_b;\n\n    interface_138 dut (\n        .data_in(data_in),\n        .clk(clk),\n        .rst(rst),\n        .data_out_a(data_out_a),\n        .data_out_b(data_out_b)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        clk = 0;\n        forever #5 clk = ~clk;\n    end\n\n    initial begin\n        rst = 1;\n        #10 rst = 0;\n    end\n\n    initial begin\n        $monitor(\"Time=%0t rst=%b data_in=%b data_out_a=%b data_out_b=%b\", $time, rst, data_in, data_out_a, data_out_b);\n        #100 $finish;\n    end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\n```",
