  "generated_text": "<think>First, I need to analyze the requirements carefully.  The. The module architecture should include 13-bit data_out register, 8-bit data_to_reg input, and several control signals including nclk, reg_dest, reg_write, and rst.  The 13-bit data_out register should be updated based on the 8-bit data_to_reg input and the reg_write signal, but only when nclk is active.  The reg_dest input selects the register destination, but it's not used in the implementation.  The rst signal should reset the data_out register to 0.  The nclk signal should be used to synchronize the update of data_out.  The reg_write signal should be used to determine if the data_to_reg should be written to the data_out register.  The reg_dest signal is not used in the current implementation, so it might be a placeholder for future expansion.  The rst signal should reset the data_out register to 0.  The nclk signal should be used to synchronize the update of data_out.  The reg_write signal should be used to determine if the data_to_reg should be written to the data_out register.  The reg_dest signal is not used in the current implementation, so it might be a placeholder for future expansion.\n\nNext, I'll design the interface.  The module should have the following ports:\n\n- data_out: 13-bit output register\n- data_to_reg: 8-bit input\n- nclk: input\n- reg_dest: 4-bit input\n- reg_write: input\n- rst: input\n\nThe implementation should be as follows:\n\n- The data_out register should be updated based on the 8-bit data_to_reg input and the reg_write signal, but only when nclk is active.\n- The reg_dest input selects the register destination, but it's not used in the implementation.\n- The rst signal should reset the data_out register to 0.\n- The nclk signal should be used to synchronize the update of data_out.\n- The reg_write signal should be used to determine if the data_to_reg should be written to the data_out register.\n- The reg_dest signal is not used in the current implementation, so it might be a placeholder for future expansion.\n\nFinally, I'll implement the logic.  The data_out register should be updated based on the 8-bit data_to_reg input and the reg_write signal, but only when nclk is active.  The rst signal should reset the data_out register to 0.  The nclk signal should be used to synchronize the update of data_out.  The reg_write signal should be used to determine if the data_to_reg should be written to the data_out register.  The reg_dest signal is not used in the current implementation, so it might be a placeholder for future expansion.\n```verilog\nmodule PipelineReg_MEMWB (\n    output reg [12:0] data_out,\n    input [7:0] data_to_reg,\n    input nclk,\n    input [3:0] reg_dest,\n    input reg_write,\n    input rst\n);\n\nalways @(posedge nclk or posedge rst) begin\n    if (rst) begin\n        data_out <= 13'b0;\n    end else if (reg_write) begin\n        data_out <= {5'b0, data_to_reg};\n    end\nend\n\nendmodule\n```\n\n```",
