The module architecture should include 3 input signals (A[2:0]) and 3 output signals (Y[2:0]), with the implied functionality of a 74x04 logic gate, which is a quad dual-input NAND gate.  The testbench should cover all possible input combinations, 8 in total, and check if the output matches the expected results.  The testbench should run for 100 ns and verify the output for each input combination.\n\nNext, I'll design the interface.  The module will have input [2:0] A and output [2:0] Y.  The testbench will use a reg [2:0] A and wire [2:0] Y, with a reg clk signal for clocking.  The testbench will use a forever block to generate clock signal and a always block to iterate through all input combinations.\n\nFor the implementation, I'll use a simple combinational logic to implement the NAND function for each bit.  The testbench will check the output for each input combination and display the results.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure the code is complete and synthesizable, and that all test cases are passed.  I'll use the $finish command to end the simulation after all test cases are complete.",
