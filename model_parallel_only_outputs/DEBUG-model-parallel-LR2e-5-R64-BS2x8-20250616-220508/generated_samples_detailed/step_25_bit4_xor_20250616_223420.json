The first XOR gate takes inputs x[0] and x[1],  the second XOR gate takes inputs x[2] and x[3],  and the third and fourth XOR gates take the outputs of the first two gates and x[0],  and x[1] respectively.  The final output o is the result of the fourth XOR gate.\n\nNext, I will design the interface for the module.  It should have one output wire o and one input wire [3:0] x.\n\nFinally, I will implement the logic of the module.  I will use four XOR gates to perform the desired operations.  I will connect the outputs of the first two XOR gates to the inputs of the third and fourth XOR gates.  The outputs of the third and fourth XOR gates will be connected to the input of the final XOR gate, which will produce the final output o.\n\nI will also implement a testbench to verify the correctness of the module.  I will define a stimulus module that provides different input patterns to the module and checks the output against expected values.  I will use assertions to ensure that the output is correct for all input patterns.\n\nI will use a stimulus module that provides different input patterns to the module and checks the output against expected values.
