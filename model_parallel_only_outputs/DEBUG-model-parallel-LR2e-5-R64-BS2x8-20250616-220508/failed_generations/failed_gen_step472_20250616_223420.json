I will connect the outputs of the first two XOR gates to the inputs of the third and fourth XOR gates.  The outputs of the third and fourth XOR gates will be connected to the input of the final XOR gate, which will produce the final output o.\n\nI will also implement a testbench to verify the correctness of the module.  I will define a stimulus module that provides different input patterns to the module and checks the output against expected values.
