from dataclasses import field, asdict # Keep asdict if used by other parts, otherwise remove.

# All Config classes (EnvConfig, ScriptConfig, EnhancedRewardConfig, RewardConfig, OptimizedTrainingConfig)
# and the function apply_optimized_config have been moved to grpo_project.configs
# This file is now a candidate for removal if no other code uses its remaining imports.
# For now, we leave the imports that might be used by other utility functions, if any,
# that were previously in this file. If this file ONLY contained configs, it can be deleted.

# If there were other utility functions or constants in this file, they would remain here.
# Example:
# MY_CONSTANT = "some_value"
# def some_utility_function():
#     pass

# For the purpose of this refactoring, assuming this file primarily held the config classes,
# it will be mostly empty or just contain imports.
# A further cleanup step might remove this file if it's truly unneeded.
