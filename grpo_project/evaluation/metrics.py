# This file will house functions and classes related to calculating
# various performance and quality metrics for the generated Verilog code
# and simulation results.

# For example, it could include:
# - F1 score for test pass rates
# - Code complexity metrics (though currently in grpo_project.utils.verilog_utils)
# - Synthesis-related metrics (future)
# - Resource utilization metrics (future)

# Example placeholder function:
# def calculate_pass_fail_ratio(passed_tests: int, total_tests: int) -> float:
#     if total_tests == 0:
#         return 0.0
#     return passed_tests / total_tests
